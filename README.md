# Testing Strategy: Playwright + Cucumber

## What is End-to-End Testing?

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a testing methodology used to validate the functionality and performance of an application by testing it from start to finish, as a user would. This type of testing ensures that the entire application flow works as expected, including interactions between different components and systems. E2E tests simulate real user scenarios and verify that the system behaves correctly under those conditions.

### Why is End-to-End Testing Needed?

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:**

   - E2E testing covers the entire application stack, including frontend and backend components. This ensures that all parts of the application work together as expected.

2. **User Experience Validation:**

   - By simulating real user interactions, E2E tests validate the user experience and ensure that the application functions correctly from the user's perspective.

3. **Early Bug Detection:**

   - E2E tests help identify issues that may not be caught by unit or integration tests, particularly those involving multiple components or systems.

4. **Confidence in Deployments:**
   - Running E2E tests as part of the deployment pipeline provides confidence that the application will work as intended in production.

## What is Playwright?

- **Rich API:**
  - Provides a rich set of features and utilities tailored specifically for end-to-end testing.

## What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It allows tests to be written in a natural language style using Gherkin syntax, which is easy for non-developers, such as product owners or business analysts, to understand and contribute to. Cucumber facilitates improved communication between technical and non-technical team members and ensures that tests align closely with business requirements.

### Key Features of Cucumber

- **Behavior-Driven Development:**
  - Enables writing tests in Gherkin syntax, a natural language format that describes the behavior of the application.
- **Improved Communication:**
  - Bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members, enhancing collaboration and understanding.
- **Reusable Steps:**
  - Allows for defining reusable steps, reducing redundancy and improving test suite maintainability.
- **Readable Documentation:**
  - Tests written in Gherkin also serve as documentation, making it easier to understand the application's expected behavior.

## What is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)?

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development methodology that encourages collaboration among developers, testers, and business stakeholders in a software project. BDD aims to improve communication and shared understanding of the software requirements by using examples to illustrate how the application should behave.

### Key Principles of BDD

1. **Collaboration:**

   - BDD involves all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and business analysts, in the development process to ensure that everyone has a shared understanding of the requirements and expected behavior of the application.

2. **Examples as Requirements:**

   - BDD uses concrete examples written in a natural language format to describe the behavior of the application. These examples are used as requirements and are implemented as automated tests.

3. **Focus on Behavior:**

   - BDD shifts the focus from testing the implementation details to testing the behavior of the application from the user's perspective. This ensures that the software meets the actual needs of the users.

4. **Executable Specifications:**
   - The examples used in BDD are written in a format that can be executed as tests. This ensures that the requirements are always up-to-date and that the application behaves as expected.

### Benefits of BDD

1. **Improved Communication:**

   - By using a common language to describe the behavior of the application, BDD improves communication between technical and non-technical team members, ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of the requirements.

2. **Shared Understanding:**

   - BDD helps create a shared understanding of the requirements and expected behavior of the application among all stakeholders, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and ensuring that the software meets the actual needs of the users.

3. **Better Test Coverage:**

   - BDD encourages the creation of detailed and comprehensive examples that cover different scenarios and edge cases, leading to better test coverage and more reliable software.

4. **Living Documentation:**
   - The examples used in BDD are written in a natural language format and serve as living documentation that evolves with the application, making it easier to understand the application's behavior and requirements over time.

### Example of BDD in Gherkin Syntax

Here's an example of a BDD scenario written in Gherkin syntax for a user login feature:

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

  Background:
    Given the user is on the login page

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When the user enters the username "student"
    And the user enters the password "Password123"
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the user should see a success message

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with missing username
    When the user enters the username ""
    And the user enters the password "Test@123"
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the login attempt should fail
    And the user should see a username required error

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with missing password
    When the user enters the username "student"
    And the user enters the password ""
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the login attempt should fail
    And the user should see a password required error

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with missing username and password
    When the user enters the username ""
    And the user enters the password ""
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the login attempt should fail
    And the user should see a username and password required error
```

## Testing Setup with Playwright and Cucumber

### `pageFixture` Overview

The `pageFixture` is a utility used to manage the Playwright `Page` object across different test scenarios. It provides methods to initialize and clear the `Page` instance, ensuring consistent test execution and resource management.

### Key Components in `hooks.ts`

- **`BeforeAll` Hook**:

  - Launches the browser and logs its version.

- **`Before` Hook**:

  - Creates a new browser context and page for each scenario. Initializes `pageFixture.page` with the current `Page` instance.

- **`AfterStep` Hook**:

  - Takes a screenshot of the page after each step and attaches it to the test report.

- **`After` Hook**:

  - Handles post-test actions, including capturing screenshots and videos, stopping tracing, and closing the page and context. Also attaches the video and trace files to the test report if the test passed.

- **`AfterAll` Hook**:
  - Closes the browser after all tests are complete.

### `login step.ts` Overview

The `login step.ts` file defines step implementations for user authentication scenarios using Playwright and Cucumber. This file includes:

- **`Given` Steps**:

  - **`the user is on the login page`**: Navigates to the login page and verifies the title.

- **`When` Steps**:

  - **`the user enters the username {string}`**: Fills in the username field with the provided value.
  - **`the user enters the password {string}`**: Fills in the password field with the provided value.
  - **`the user clicks on the login button`**: Clicks the login button.

- **`Then` Steps**:
  - **`the user should see a success message`**: Checks if a success message is visible.
  - **`the login attempt should fail`**: Verifies that an error message is visible for failed login attempts.
  - **`the user should see a username required error`**: Checks if the username required error message is displayed.
  - **`the user should see a password required error`**: Checks if the password required error message is displayed.
  - **`the user should see a username and password required error`**: Checks if the username and password required error message is displayed.
